ArtRC Movies

ArtRC Movies is a powerful movie search application built with React that aims to provide users with comprehensive access to movie information. The platform enables users to search for movies and explore a vast database, offering details about numerous movies.

Concept :

ArtRC Movies stands out by its capability to surface an extensive collection of movies. For instance, searching for a term like "Batman" doesn't just return a couple of movies; it fetches an extensive list that includes over 500 movies related to Batman in the title, cast, or theme. This comprehensive search functionality ensures users can explore a wide range of movies related to their query, offering an immersive movie discovery experience.

Live Site :

The website is live and accessible at [ArtRC Movies](https://1z99.github.io/movie/). Feel free to explore the extensive movie database and search for your favorite movies!

Features :

Search Movies: Enter any movie title, keyword, or phrase to discover a vast array of movies related to the search term.
Filtering Options: Narrow down search results by specifying movie type (movie/series) and release year.
Pagination: Display search results with pagination for better navigation through extensive lists of movies.
YouTube API Quota Limitation
Please note that due to YouTube's API quota limitations, the availability of movie trailers may be affected. YouTube allows a limited number of queries per day, and if the trailer is not available, it might be due to reaching the daily quota limit for accessing YouTube's API.
