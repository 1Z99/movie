<h1>Artrc Movies</h1>

<p>Artrc Movies is a powerful movie search application built with React that aims to provide users with comprehensive access to movie information. The platform enables users to search for movies and explore a vast database, offering details about numerous movies.</p>

<h2>Concept</h2>

<p>ArtRC Movies stands out by its capability to surface an extensive collection of movies. For instance, searching for a term like "Batman" doesn't just return a couple of movies; it fetches an extensive list that includes over 500 movies related to Batman in the title, cast, or theme. This comprehensive search functionality ensures users can explore a wide range of movies related to their query, offering an immersive movie discovery experience.</p>

<h2>Live Site</h2>

<p>The website is live and accessible at <a href="https://1z99.github.io/movie/" target="_blank">Artrc Movies</a>. Feel free to explore the extensive movie database and search for your favorite movies!</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Search Movies:</strong> Enter any movie title, keyword, or phrase to discover a vast array of movies related to the search term.</li>
  <li><strong>Filtering Options:</strong> Narrow down search results by specifying movie type (movie/series) and release year.</li>

<h2>YouTube API Quota Limitation</h2>
